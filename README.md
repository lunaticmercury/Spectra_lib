# Spectra Library

A Python library for custom FFT, cross-spectrum, and PSD calculations, with support for optimized algorithms across multiple decades.
In some signal processing computation specific spectrum tools can be really useful like a multipurpose Swiss Army knife.

## Features
- **Custom FFT**: Compute the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of a signal.
- **Cross-Spectrum**: Calculate cross-spectral density between two signals with support for averaging.
- **PSD Calculation**: Power Spectral Density (PSD) estimation for a signal with optimized algorithms for fast processing across 4 decades.
- **Multi-Decade Optimized Algorithms**: Enhanced speed for cross-spectrum and PSD calculations using multiple decades.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lunaticmercury/Spectra_lib.git
```
Install dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
